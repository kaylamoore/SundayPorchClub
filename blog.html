	<h3>Chicago's Big Ten Tailgate</h3>

	<p>After a long work week, coming off a blurry Halloweekend, we at Sunday Porch Club were itching to relive the glory days of game day tailgating. So we figured, hey we love the Northwestern Wildcats, and also love football, why not hit up the Northwestern Football game against Penn State this Saturday. Obviously, we needed to get a ton of booze and chips to satisfy our unparalleled tolerance for beer and food. The most logical next step was to hit up the Hodgkins Wal-Mart and load up on inexpensive, yet reliable supplies. While we are still pursuing more funding for our enterprise, Busch Light made the most financial sense because itâ€™s cheaper than other beers, and you get 6 more! Oh yea, not to mention, you can drink about a BILLION of them and still be able to feel your face!

	After a daring trip to Wal-Mart, we were fully prepared to kickoff our Saturday Morning tailgate. We took it pretty easy on Friday night to make sure our minds and bodies were in peak shape.
